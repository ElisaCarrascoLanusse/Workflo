Workflo is an app meant to help you increase your productivity
and manage your time without distractions. Similar to the
Pomodoro method it works with a timer, however, it is meant to
avoid breaking your workflow by giving you more agency over the
time you spend working.

## How To Use

1. Set and input your goal, focus on actionable steps and be specific.
2. Set the amount of time in minutes that you think it will take you to accomplish your goal.
3. Press start for the timer to start running and focus on your task.
4. Once you feel you have reached 50% of your focus threshold take a break. Workflo will calculate the length of your break based on the amount of time you spent working.
5. When your break is finished the work timer will resume. This should allow you to maintain your focus and productivity without burning you out or disrupting your flow.
